# A pipe smoker carries one box of matches in his left pocket and one box in the right. Initially, each box contains $n$ matches. If he needs a match, the smoker is equally likely to choose either pocket. What is the frequency function for the number of matches in the other box when he first discovers that one box is empty?
* $X$ is the random variable where he samples an empty box. $k$ is the number of matches left in the other box.
* Out of the $2n - k$ matches that are sampled, we choose $n$ to be sampled from the empty pocket
* Either the left or the right can be empty
* We sample $2n - k$ matches with probability of $0.5$, and the empty pocket with probability of $0.5$

$$p_X(k) = 2 \binom{2n - k}{n} * 0.5^{2n - k + 1}$$
